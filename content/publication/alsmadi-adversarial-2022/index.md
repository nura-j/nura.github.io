abstract: 'Machine learning algorithms represent the intelligence that controls many
  information systems and applications around us. As such, they are targeted by attackers
  to impact their decisions. Text created by machine learning algorithms has many
  types of applications, some of which can be considered malicious especially if there
  is an intention to present machine-generated text as human-generated. In this paper,
  we surveyed major subjects in adversarial machine learning for text processing applications.
  Unlike adversarial machine learning in images, text problems and applications are
  heterogeneous. Thus, each problem can have its own challenges. We focused on some
  of the evolving research areas such as: malicious versus genuine text generation
  metrics, defense against adversarial attacks, and text generation models and algorithms.
  Our study showed that as applications of text generation will continue to grow in
  the near future, the type and nature of attacks on those applications and their
  machine learning algorithms will continue to grow as well. Literature survey indicated
  an increasing trend in using pre-trained models in machine learning. Word/sentence
  embedding models and transformers are examples of those pre-trained models. Adversarial
  models may utilize same or similar pre-trained models as well. In another trend
  related to text generation models, literature showed effort to develop universal
  text perturbations to be used in both blackand white-box attack settings. Literature
  showed also using conditional GANs to create latent representation for writing types.
  This usage will allow for a seamless lexical and grammatical transition between
  various writing styles. In text generation metrics, research trends showed developing
  successful automated or semi-automated assessment metrics that may include human
  judgement. Literature showed also research trends of designing and developing new
  memory models that increase performance and memory utilization efÔ¨Åciency without
  validating real-time constraints. Many research efforts evaluate different defense
  model approaches and algorithms. Researchers evaluated different types of targeted
  attacks, and methods to distinguish human versus machine generated text.'
